            I've worked with literally hundreds of HTML/CSS developers and I
            have to say the top spot goes to this guy. This guy is an amazing
            developer. He stresses on good, clean code and pays heed to the
            details. I love developers who respect each and every aspect of a
            throughly thought out design and do their best to put it in code. He
            goes over and beyond and transforms ART into PIXELS - without a
            glitch, every time.
